# Deep Learning Based Tamper Localization

## Overview 

This project provides a deep learning-based solution for **image tamper localization**. 
The goal is to detect and localize regions within digital images that have been manipulated or tampered with, using advanced neural network architectures. 

## Features 

**End-to-end deep learning pipeline** for tamper localization 
- Support for various image manipulation types (copy-move, splicing, removal)
- Pre-trained model weights and easy inference scripts
- Evaluation metrics for localization accuracy

## Requirements 

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (recommended version: 1.7+)
- OpenCV - NumPy - Matplotlib
